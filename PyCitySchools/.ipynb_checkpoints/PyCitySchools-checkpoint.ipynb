    "- Executive Summary:\n",
    "  This analysis takes a look at data from 15 different schools and attempts to evaluate \n",
    "  the performance of the schools based on the following data categorizations:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      - Highest performing schools based on the overall passing percentage.\n",
    "      - Loweset performing schools based on the overall passing percentage.\n",
    "      - Both math and reading scores by grade level.\n",
    "      - And, math and reading scores based on each each school's spending, size, and school type. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The first dataframe titled, 'schools_data_complete,' is produced by merging two datasets, and subsequently, \n",
    "  various variables and dataframes are created using this dataframe for the analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Findings:\n",
    "  Upon analysis of the dataframes that were created, as a whole, charter schools outperformed district schools when\n",
    "  looking at the average percentage of 'overall passing' â€” calculated by dividing the number of students that passed \n",
    "  BOTH math and reading by the total number of students. In fact, when sorting the schools based on their respective\n",
    "  'overall passing' rates, the top five schools were charter schools, while the bottom five were district schools.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Additionally, schools that were categorized as small(i.e., less than 1000 students) or medium(i.e. between 1000-2000\n",
    "  students) considerably outperformed large schools (i.e., 2000-5000 students) in 'overall passing.' Furthermore, \n",
    "  and contrary to the assumption that increased spending will increase school performance, schools that spent less\n",
    "  than 585(USD) and between 585-630(USD) performed better than schools that spent more per student. \n",
